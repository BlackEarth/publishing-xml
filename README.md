# ![publishing-xml](design/pub-Logo-02.png)

Publishing XML defines a shared set of XML vocabularies (“schemas”) for professional publishing. The purpose is to define an XML flavor that covers all publishing needs while maintaining maximum compatibility with existing systems. 
It fills a gap in the publishing XML ecosystem: There has been no comprehensive schema to cover the needs of publishing in general. Publishing XML is to publishing what EPUB3 is to digital publishing. Like EPUB3, it

* makes use of the XHTML-flavor of HTML5 as the core content document type. This provides for maximum compatibility with other content systems.
* makes use of the Dublin-Core and related vocabularies for publication metadata.
* provides extra vocabulary and semantics for dealing with the needs of publishing that are not met by HTML5 semantics.

The Publishing XML ecosystem also provides shared tools for using these schemas. So far there is:

* **pubxml**  — Python tools for working with Publishing XML. (<https://github.com/BlackEarth/pubxml>)

To install the schemas, download / clone this repository to an appropriate location on your system.
