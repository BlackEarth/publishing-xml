Publishing XML provides schemas for professional publishing. 

The purpose is to define an XML flavor that covers all publishing needs while maintaining maximum compatibility with existing systems.

[Content Documents](docs/Content-Documents.docx) lists the structures in Word, WordPress, InDesign, and HTML5. This helps us think about how to make the conversions between formats, and how to define the "central" format, Publishing XML.
